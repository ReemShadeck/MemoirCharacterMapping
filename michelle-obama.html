            <p>"And so I gave my approval to his first run for office, larding it with a bit of wifely caution. “I think you’ll be frustrated,” I warned. “If you end up getting elected, you’re gonna go down there and nothing will get accomplished, no matter how hard you try. It’ll drive you crazy.” “Maybe,” Barack said, with a bemused shrug. “But maybe I can do some good. Who knows?” “That’s right,” I said, shrugging back. It wasn’t my job to interfere with his optimism. “Who knows?”"(Obama 183)</p>
